# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various medical attributes.

## 💡 Overview
This notebook trains and evaluates a classification model using common machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, and more.

## 📂 Files
- `HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧠 ML Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- (You can add more models or tuning if applicable)

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is commonly known as the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter or VS Code
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## 📌 Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Add more models
